**User**

Could you help me inspect the @current_architecture_3.md , and carry out the instructions noted in there?

For your information, the entry point for running agent is @run_agent.py . The relevant code for the agent can be found in `src/parrhesia/flow_agent`. 

---

**Cursor**

I'll scan the agent code to verify the architecture and identify inner/outer loop budgets and stop conditions, then I'll pull in the key implementations to cite exact lines.

Let me locate the agent implementation and related modules (MCTSAgent, actions, transition, discovery, rate finder) so I can verify the architecture and extract the exact stop conditions and reward handling.

I'll open the key modules in the agent to extract the outer/inner loop mechanics, budgets, and reward computation, and then cite the exact lines.

I'll open the agent outer-loop implementation and related modules (`transition.py`, `hotspot_discovery.py`) to extract the stop conditions and flow of inner/outer loops, then cite exact lines.

### What matches your write-up vs the code

- 1 inner loop ≈ 1 MCTS run that proposes a single regulation for a specific hotspot/time-window, chosen via `PickHotspot` → `AddFlow/RemoveFlow` → `Continue` → `Confirm` → `Commit`.
- Commit triggers rate finding (local evaluation) over the selected TV and window only; the returned ΔJ is used as the immediate reward (negative in MCTS) and then backpropagated.
- A committed regulation is appended to the plan and cannot be modified/removed by the agent.
- When the outer loop budget allows, the agent runs more inner loops to append more regulations; after the run ends, a final global evaluation is computed (no backprop at the end of the episode).

### Where your write-up is not accurate

- Hotspot inventory is NOT recomputed after each commitment. It’s built once (per outer “master” run) and then candidates are pruned as they’re used or banned.
```649:662:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/agent.py
descs = self.inventory.build_from_segments(...)
candidates = self.inventory.to_candidate_payloads(descs)
```
```294:321:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/agent.py
def _remove_hotspot_candidate(...):
    ... if (tv, t0, t1) == target: removed = True
    ... if removed: state.metadata["hotspot_candidates"] = filtered
```

- There is no explicit mechanism that “prevents flights that already had their delay assigned from getting another round of delay assignment” between inner commits. The agent stores regulations and only computes a global schedule/objective at the end (and during commit evaluations), but it doesn’t persist “assigned delay flags” back into the candidate discovery or mutate the inventory between commits.

### Inner-loop and outer-loop budgets and exact stop conditions

- Inner loop (MCTS) budgets
  - max simulations:
```464:474:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/mcts.py
for i in range(sims):
```
  - time budget:
```465:477:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/mcts.py
if now > t_end: ... stop_reason = "time_budget_exhausted"; break
```
  - global action budget across selection/expansion/step/backup:
```404:415:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/mcts.py
self._actions_done += 1
if self._action_budget is not None and self._actions_done >= self._action_budget:
    raise MCTS._ActionBudgetExhausted()
```
```877:881:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/mcts.py
# expansion counts as one action
self._inc_action("expand", ...)
```
```1151:1153:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/mcts.py
# selection counts as one action
self._inc_action("select", ...)
```
```1227:1232:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/mcts.py
# environment/state transition counts as one action
self._inc_action("step", ...)
```
```2082:2084:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/mcts.py
# backprop counts as one action
self._inc_action("backup", ...)
```
  - per-simulation commit budget:
```931:949:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/mcts.py
if sig[0] == "commit" and commits_used >= commit_depth: continue
```
```1343:1391:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/mcts.py
if is_terminal or commits_used >= commit_depth: ... reason="commit_budget" ... return total_return
```
  - commit evaluation budget (limits calls into RateFinder):
```1750:1762:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/mcts.py
outstanding = self._commit_calls + self._pending_commit_count()
if outstanding >= int(self.cfg.commit_eval_limit):
    rates, delta_j, info = ({}, 0.0, {"reason": "eval_budget_exhausted"})
```
  - “min unique commit evaluations” exploration control (forces exploration/backtracking until a minimum number of distinct commit signatures are evaluated):
```991:1016:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/mcts.py
if selection_records and len(self._commit_eval_cache) < int(self.cfg.min_unique_commit_evals):
    ... choose action by prior weights (forced explore) ...
```
```1021:1047:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/mcts.py
if best_sig[0] == "commit" and len(self._commit_eval_cache) < int(self.cfg.min_unique_commit_evals):
    ... forced backtrack for unique commit ...
```

- RateFinder budgets (per commit evaluation)
  - evaluation call limit:
```315:318:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/rate_finder.py
eval_call_limit = min(int(self.config.max_eval_calls), int(flow_count) * (int(rate_grid_len) + 3))
```
  - returns diagnostics including eval_calls and stopped_early:
```587:605:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/rate_finder.py
"eval_calls": eval_calls, ... "stopped_early": stopped_early
```

- Outer loop (agent) budgets/stop
  - number of master runs, time, total inner MCTS actions:
```842:883:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/agent.py
if self.outer_max_runs is not None and master_runs_executed >= self.outer_max_runs: break
if self.outer_max_time_s is not None and (now - master_start) >= ...: break
if self.outer_max_actions is not None and master_actions_total >= ...: break
```
  - how many inner commits are attempted in one master run (outer loop budget):
```747:756:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/agent.py
commit_depth_limit = int(max(0, self.mcts_cfg.commit_depth))
configured_inner_commit_limit = (int(self.max_inner_loop_commits_and_evals) if ... else None)
outer_loop_budget = (int(max(0, configured_inner_commit_limit)) if ... else commit_depth_limit)
```
  - inner-loop repetition within a master run (adds at most `outer_loop_budget` regulations):
```969:987:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/agent.py
for _ in range(max(1, int(outer_loop_budget))):
    ... commit_action = mcts.run(...)
```
  - early stop if no local improvement (ΔJ ≥ 0):
```1460:1511:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/agent.py
if self.early_stop_no_improvement and delta_j >= 0.0:
    outer_stop_reason = "no_improvement"; break
```
  - stop when inner-commit limit reached (if configured):
```1515:1545:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/agent.py
if self.max_inner_loop_commits_and_evals is not None and commits >= self.max_inner_loop_commits_and_evals:
    ... on_limit_hit("inner_commit_limit_reached") ...
```
  - after inner-loop(s), compute final objective (no backprop):
```1546:1552:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/agent.py
with self._timed("agent.final_objective"):
    final_summary = self._compute_final_objective(state)
```

### Hotspot detection and window = hotspot duration

```125:132:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/hotspot_discovery.py
t0 = int(seg.get("start_bin", 0)); t1_incl = int(seg.get("end_bin", t0))
... window_bins = (t0, t1_incl + 1)  # half-open [t0, t1)
```

Flows and proxies passed to state:

```311:329:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/hotspot_discovery.py
meta = {
    "flow_to_flights": {k: list(v) for k, v in selected.items()},
    "flow_proxies": {k: proxies.get(k, ...).tolist() for k in selected.keys()},
}
desc = HotspotDescriptor(... candidate_flow_ids=..., metadata=meta)
```

MCTS uses those proxies for priors and shaping:

```1483:1499:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/mcts.py
proxies = ctx.metadata.get("flow_proxies", {}) or {}
...
if isinstance(a, AddFlow):
    proxy = np.asarray(proxies.get(a.flow_id, []), dtype=float)
    ...
```

### Run-time parameters from the entrypoint

- Inner MCTS (example run config):
```718:728:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/examples/flow_agent/run_agent.py
mcts_cfg = MCTSConfig(
    max_sims=8192,
    commit_depth=512,
    commit_eval_limit=512,
    max_actions=None,
    seed=69420,
    ...
)
```
- RateFinder (local eval):
```742:743:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/examples/flow_agent/run_agent.py
rf_cfg = RateFinderConfig(use_adaptive_grid=True, max_eval_calls=192, fast_scorer_enabled=False)
```
- Outer loop (agent) including inner-loop commit cap per run:
```1146:1155:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/examples/flow_agent/run_agent.py
agent = MCTSAgent(...,
    # max number of commits before moving the outer loop forward
    max_inner_loop_commits_and_evals=32,
    ... outer_max_runs=..., outer_max_time_s=..., outer_max_actions=..., ...)
```

### Final notes

- The “local reward” used by MCTS is ΔJ at the selected TV/window only (with potential shaping). The global/system objective is computed only at the end of an outer run; there’s no end-of-episode backprop.
- Committed regulations are appended and then “banned” from re-selection; hotspots used are removed from the candidate list. No inventory recomputation is performed between commits inside a run.

- If-condition worth noting: commit action at confirm is pruned when the same (TV, window, mode, exact flow set) is present in the plan or in `banned_regulations`.
```1572:1604:/mnt/d/project-tailwind/src/parrhesia/flow_agent/mcts.py
def _commit_is_banned(...):
    banned_entries = metadata.get("banned_regulations") or []
    ...
    if entry_tv == tv and entry_window == window_bins and entry_mode == mode and entry_flows == selected_flows:
        return True
```

Summary
- Verified the inner loop: choose hotspot → select flows → confirm → commit; commit triggers RateFinder (local to TV/window) and reward uses -ΔJ with shaping; backprop updates Q.
- Verified the outer loop: repeats inner runs up to `outer_loop_budget`, stops on outer limits (runs/time/actions) or early stop; appends immutable regulations; computes a final plan objective only at the end.
- Corrected two points: hotspot inventory is not recomputed after each commit, and there’s no explicit “already delayed” flight protection across inner commits; pruning is done via banned specs and candidate removal instead.
